            <p>During a 12-24 hour shift, workers often cannot stop to eat a real meal so <strong>Feed The Heroes </strong> is dedicated
            to keeping valuable medical teams fed. With the this initiative, some economically-challenged restaurants could
            rehire laid-off staff to prepare the food necessary to keep medical professionals healthy and working.</p>
